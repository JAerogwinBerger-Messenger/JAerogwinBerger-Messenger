First repository for college courses

# I am **Justin Aerogwin Berger-Messenger**
## Currently pursuing a **Interdisciplinary Studies** degree
## Minor in Comp. Sci. and TESOL
### I will be planning a project to work with English Language Learners for my TESOL Minor
#### In this project I will be learning about how to teach, assess and contribute to someone learning the English language. Creating a sequence of events much like code I will need to develop a teaching plan for future students.
### I am also going to be contributing to my twitch and youtube channels.
#### I play a variety of games but ultimately am looking to find a career in game devolopment. The biggest hurdle is scheduling time for content and continuing to study for quality education. Spending up to 20 hours a week sounds possible at time of writing 13/Jan/2026
